# Python Machine Learning – Linear Regression Enhancement using Gemini AI

This project is based on the Spoken Tutorial course **Python for Machine Learning**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict employee salary based on years of experience using Linear Regression. The original code provided in the Spoken Tutorial course was enhanced using **Gemini AI in Google Colab** to make it more professional and suitable for real-world Machine Learning applications.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
